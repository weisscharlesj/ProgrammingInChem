# Materials for entropy lab

Data from Giauque, W. F.; Blue, R. W. Hydrogen Sulfide. The Heat Capacity and Vapor Pressure of Solid and Liquid. The Heat of Vaporization. A Comparison of Thermodynamic and Spectroscopic Values of the Entropy. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1936, 58 (5) 831–837.

Activity based off of “Conventional Entropies and the Third Law of Thermodynamics” from Zielinski, T. J. Fostering Creative Learning Using Instructional Symbolic Mathematics Documents. J. Chem. Educ. 2009, 86 (12) 1466-1469. 

The use of H2S data was origionally implemented by Dr. Richard Dalinger of Wabash College.
